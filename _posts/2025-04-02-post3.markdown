Welcome back! In this post, we’ll put all the pieces together — literally. Let’s solder, flash, and get our environment-sensing mesh network up and running!

## Soldering: The Gentle Art of Not Burning Down Your House

<img src="/img/wireless_thermostat_post3/6.jpeg" style="max-width: 20%" class="responsive-img">
The **Hub** is the chill one in the group — no soldering needed. Just pop the Seeed Xiao ESP32C3 into the enclosure (don’t forget the adorable little antenna paper thingy) and you're done.

The **Thermometers** are where the fun begins. Once your PCBs arrive, it’s pretty straightforward — everything’s labeled on the board.

Now, about those **pads on the bottom of the ESP32C6**: yes, you need to solder those too, especially the **BAT + / -** pads. Easiest way? Solder paste and a hot plate.
<img src="/img/wireless_thermostat_post3/8.gif" style="max-width: 20%" class="responsive-img">
No hot plate? A low-heat soldering iron might work. No low heat? Use a regular iron and nerves of steel. Just... don’t burn yourself or your house.

Once soldered:

- Hook up the battery.
- Pop it into the enclosure.
- Skip the antenna here — the C6 has a built-in one, unless you are planning to place a Thermometer far from your router.

## Flashing the Firmware:

Go to my GitHub repo and grab the `.bin` files from the **Firmware** folder. Make sure to pick the right firmware: **Server** for the hub, **Client** for the thermometers.

<img src="/img/wireless_thermostat_post3/7.jpeg" class="responsive-img">
1. Plug the device into your computer.
2. Open this tool in your browser: [<u>Espressif Web Flasher</u>](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/#)
3. Click the blue **Connect** button, select your device, and hit **Connect** again.
4. If all goes well, some lovely chip details will appear in the black terminal.
5. Click **Choose File**, select the appropriate `.bin`.
6. **Important**: Set **Flash Address** to `0`.
7. Click **Program** and wait for it to finish.

Once done:

- Click **Disconnect**.
- Under **Console**, click **Start**, connect again, then hit **Reset**.

If you see:

```
wm:StartAP with SSID: EnvironmenTor
wm:AP IP address: 192.168.4.1
wm:Starting Web Portal
```

You nailed it. Check your phone — a new WiFi network should pop up: `EnvironmenTor-Server` or `EnvironmenTor-Client`.

If not, head to the FAQ section bellow. I got you.

## Connecting the System

### Hub Setup

1. Power it up via USB.
2. It’ll create a temporary WiFi network called `EnvironmenTor-Server`.
3. Connect to it with your phone/tablet/computer.
4. Enter your home WiFi credentials in the portal.
5. Boom. It’s now on your network and you can access the web app at:  
   `http://environmentor.local`

#### FAQ

- If you cannot access `http://environmentor.local` after going through the first steps try to to restart it (unplug and plug the USB and battery if on client).
- If it is still not accessible try to restart you browser or use another browser or another device.
- Check in your phone that there is no WiFi network called "Environmentor-Server" - if yes, go through the initial setup steps again.
- If it is still not accessible:

  - Hook it up to your computer and open in your browser `https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/#`
  - Under "Console" click on "Start" , select the device on the pop-up window and hit "Connect".
  - In the black window you will see a debug log (if not hit the "Reset" button above it).

    - If you see something like:

      ```
      wm:AutoConnect: SUCCESS
      wm:STA IP Address: 192.168.31.249
      Connected to WiFi
      App available at 192.168.31.249
      mDNS responder started
      HTTP server started
      ```

      It means that you can access the app from your browser in the address `192.168.31.249`

    - If you see something like:
      ```
      wm:StartAP with SSID: EnvironmenTor
      wm:AP IP address: 192.168.4.1
      wm:Starting Web Portal
      ```

    It means that it is not connected to your home network, and you need to go over the initial setup again.

    - For Client only - if you see something like "Couldn't find SHT4x or SHT3x or AHTx" it means that you didn't solder the sensor to the PCB correctly.
    - If you see anything else the formware install probably didn't went well - try to go over the firmware installation again.

### Thermometer (Client) Setup

1. Power it up (battery or USB).
2. It’ll create a WiFi network called `EnvironmenTor-Client` (if not, go the the FAQ section)
3. Connect and configure WiFi just like the Hub.

Now let’s pair it:
**_The pairing button is the button we soldered to the PCB, you can reach it with a pin through a small hole in the enclosure lid._**

- Hold the button for **5–7 seconds** until the LED starts flashing, then release.
- Wait for the LED to turn on again for **2 seconds** — success!
- If it blinks 3 times instead, pairing failed.

While in pairing mode, you can:

- Rename the thermometer
- Set the sleep interval
- Enable external antenna
- Calibrate humidity, and more

To **exit pairing mode**:

- Hold the button for 5–7 seconds again, or
- Wait 2 minutes — it’ll exit automatically

To **factory reset**:

- Hold the button for **10+ seconds** until the LED flashes like it just saw a ghost (around 30 rapid blinks), then release.

## Using the System: Welcome to Your Mesh Empire

<img src="/img/wireless_thermostat_post3/9.jpeg" style="max-width: 25%" class="responsive-img">

Once devices are added, you can view them all at: [<u>http://environmentor.local</u>](http://environmentor.local)

On larger screens, you'll see all devices in a row. On smaller screens, swipe left/right to switch views.

- **Top right of each device card**: Battery percentage or a dot (charging).
- **Bottom of each card**: Temperature and humidity history graph (up to 100 data points).

You can add new devices anytime by activating pairing mode. Already-paired devices will be recognized automatically.

---

## While in Pairing Mode

<img src="/img/wireless_thermostat_post3/11.jpeg"  class="responsive-img">

- Measurements are taken every **2 seconds**.
- A green icon will appear in the device card on the web app
- **Rename the device**: Click the pencil/edit icon, type the new name, click save.
- **Change refresh interval**: Default is 3 minutes. Shorter = faster updates, but significantly shorter battery life. Longer = more chill, and significantly more life.
- **Enable external antenna**: Useful if you’re having range issues.
- **Humidity calibration**: Add a constant offset if needed.
- **Firmware updates**:

  - **Thermometers**: Go to settings → click **Update Firmware**, choose your new `.bin`, and hit update.
  - **Hub**: On big screens, use the top-right cloud/arrow icon. On smaller screens, find it in the hamburger menu.
    <br><br>

- **Remove a device**: Even when not in pairing mode, click the trash icon and confirm.

---

## Quick Actions

- **Single measurement on demand**: One short press on the pairing button.
- **Soft reset**: Use the tiny button labeled "R" next to the USB port or unplug it.
- **Hard (factory) reset**: Hold the pairing button for **10+ seconds** until the LED flashes like crazy, then release.

## More FAQ

- **How many Thermometers can I connect to one hub?** - at the moment as many as you need.
- **Can I connect the Thermometer to HomeAssistant/ESPHome?** - Yes, but you will loose all other functionalities and will be bound to the HomeAssistant system, [<u>See here</u>](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/sht3xd.html).
- **Can I connect the Thermometer to Apple HomeKit/Alexa/Google?** - Yes, the ESP32C6 supports Matter and Thread, but you will loose all other functionalities and will be bound to the connected system. You will have to install a specific firmware (there are a few examples on the Web).

## That’s a Wrap

You’re officially running your own distributed climate monitoring network. You soldered, flashed, and configured like a pro.
Ahhhh...feng shui.

See you on my next project!
