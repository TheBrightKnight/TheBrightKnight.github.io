## Welcome back, my fellow cable-overlords!

<img src="/img/powerbox_post1/1.jpg" class="responsive-img">

I honestly have no clue where to start with this one. This project? Oh, it’s just my longest, biggest, most complicated, most hair-pulling, sleep-depriving, "why do I even do this to myself" project ever. But hey, I survived, I learned a ton, and now you get to learn from my chaos. Who knows, maybe you’ll even build one yourself!
<br>
<br>

So, after two years of trial, error, and moments of existential dread, I present to you – _drumroll_ – **The PowerBox!**
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## The Great Cable Disaster™

Now, if you’ve dabbled in astrophotography for more than five minutes, you’ve probably encountered **The Great Cable Disaster™**. Cables everywhere. Dangling. Tangling. Creating their own gravity wells.

Maybe you’ve had a meridian flip that turned into a full-blown rig flip (bonus points if something snapped in the process). Maybe a rogue cable decided to yoink your expensive camera’s USB connection straight to the afterlife. Or, if you’re extra lucky, a random neighborhood cat used your rig as a jungle gym, and all your night’s hard work turned into a gallery of _not-so-artistic_ star trails.

Even when you _think_ you’ve got cable management under control – spoiler alert – you don’t. Not for long, anyway.

So, like any good problem-solver (or desperate hobbyist on a budget), you go online. And what do you find? Power boxes! The magical fix! Only, oh wait… they cost a small fortune. Because of course they do.

That’s when I said, “Enough of this!” and decided to build my own. But not just _any_ DIY power box – I wanted something better, smarter, and, most importantly, _way_ cheaper.

And I did it. It’s beautiful. It’s powerful. It’s got more bells and whistles than a spaceship. Voltage readings? Check. Load monitoring? Check. Full control over each output? Oh yeah. The PowerBox isn’t just a power solution – it’s the power solution.

## The Must-Have Features:

<img src="/img/powerbox_post1/4.jpeg"  class="responsive-img">

- **Controlled DC Outputs** – At least 4 of them, because why stop at one?
- **Controlled RCA Output** – Dew heaters love these, and we love dew heaters.
- **Always-On Outputs** – Because some things just need to stay powered, like your unwavering astrophotography obsession.
- **Independent Voltage & Amperage Readings** – So you actually know what’s sucking up all your power.
- **Robust Outputs** – No wimpy connections here; we’re talking serious power handling.
- **Temperature & Humidity Sensors** – For automatic smart dew heater control. Fancy, huh?
- **Special Ports for Extra Accessories** – Bluetooth modules, external sensors, future gadgets... whatever your tinkering heart desires.
- **ASCOM Support** – So it plays nice with N.I.N.A and other software.
- **Custom Software** – For remote control, tweaking settings, and looking extra cool.

Naturally, there were _incidents_ along the way. Burnt boards. Exploding components. A few choice words yelled into the void. So, I added some extra protections:

- **Reverse Voltage Protection** – Because mistakes happen.
- **High/Low Voltage Protection** – Because gear is expensive.
- **High Load Protection** – Because you _will_ try to power everything at once.
- **Temperature Protection** – Because nothing should melt.
- **Theft Protection\*** – Because of people.
- **Wife Protection\*** – Because sometimes you need to justify why you just bought _another_ rig.

> _Fine print: These last two don’t actually exist, but hey, one can dream._

## Enter: The Pro Version

<img src="/img/powerbox_post1/2.jpeg"  class="responsive-img">

Of course, I didn’t stop there. As the project grew, I got feedback (and more wild ideas), so I ended up making _two_ versions:

1. **The Essential** – The basic-but-awesome version with all the must-haves.
2. **The Pro** – Because “Pro” sounds cooler, and I wanted to add _even more_ stuff:
   - A USB 3.0 hub with 4 USB3.0 and 2 USB2.0 ports.
   - A dedicated 5V power line for the hub and other goodies.
   - _More_ DC outputs, because why not?

<br>
<br>

## But Wait, There’s Software!

What’s the point of fancy hardware if you don’t have killer software to match? Here’s what I made sure to include:

- **Smart Heater Control** – Based on temperature & humidity, because logic is nice.
- **Live Amperage Graphs** – See power usage in real time!
- **Total Session Power Monitoring** – So you know exactly how much juice your setup is drinking.
- **Customizable Output Names** – No more guessing which port does what.
- **Flexible Control Modes** – PWM or On/Off? You decide!
- **Remote Access** – Control your PowerBox from anywhere, including your phone.
- **Software & Hardware Updates** – Because future-you will want even more features.

So, my dear reader, are you ready to embark on this journey of DIY brilliance? Keep reading – trust me, it’s worth it.
