Yep, I did it again. Another weekend, another sensor, another project. At this point, I might have more microcontrollers than socks. But hey, who needs fashion when you can have real-time soil nutrient monitoring?

So today, I bring you my latest gardening-tech masterpiece ‚Äì an NPK monitoring system!

Yes, you heard that right! This little gadget will let you monitor your plant‚Äôs **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels** over the network. No more guessing, no more generic nutrient schedules‚Äîjust smart, plant-specific insights tailored to its growth stage.

Best part? This is a short and easy read, so stick around.

#### Why Even Bother?

Some people have a mystical, almost magical connection with their plants. They just _know_ when a plant needs more nitrogen or when it's silently screaming for phosphorus.

For the rest of us? Well‚Ä¶ we rely on charts, schedules, and a bit of luck. But here‚Äôs the thing: nutrient needs vary based on plant type, species, environment, and a whole bunch of other factors.

A real-time monitoring system solves this guesswork by giving you the data straight from the soil itself. No more nutrient deficiencies, no more overfeeding disasters‚Äîjust happy, healthy plants!

Sure, there are other nutrients (Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, etc.), but let‚Äôs not get carried away‚Äîthose sensors are pricey! üòÖ We‚Äôre keeping it simple.

#### How Much Does This Cost?

Roughly 45-50 Euros‚Äîcheaper than replacing your dead plants over and over!

#### What Do You Need?

##### **The Essentials:**

- **NPK Sensor** ([Get it here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001524845572.html))
  - More about the sensor in [ComwinTop](https://store.comwintop.com/products/rs485-4-20ma-soil-temperature-humidity-moisture-conductivity-ec-ph-sensor?variant=43435240227043)
  - Check the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheBrightKnight/smart_npk_sensor) for docs
  - _Note:_ There are other sensors that also measure pH, EC, and moisture, but we'll need to tweak the code to use them.
- **RS485 module** ‚Äì This lets your microcontroller talk to the sensor.
- **ESP32 microcontroller** ([Recommended model](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006336964908.html))

##### **Bonus Upgrades (For Those Who Like Things Neat & Tidy):**

- **DC Power Socket** ‚Äì [Buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003742132830.html) _(DC007B 5.5x2.1mm)_
- **XH2.54 Header Connector** ‚Äì [Buy here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006027334406.html) _(4-pin, Vertical SMD)_
- **Custom PCB** ‚Äì To make things super clean (details below).

##### Wiring: Choose Your Path!

**For the DIY warriors:** Love the classic "cable-chaos" aesthetic‚Ñ¢? No problem! Here‚Äôs a simple wiring schematic to follow.

**For the cool kids:** I designed a custom PCB to make everything fit nicely and tightly.

- Gerber files available [on GitHub](https://github.com/TheBrightKnight/smart_npk_sensor)
- Send them to your favorite PCB manufacturer (JLCPCB, PCBWay, etc.) and get yourself a sleek, pro-level board.

Oh, and if you like things extra polished, grab the 3D-printable enclosure files from the repo and print yourself a pro-looking case.
